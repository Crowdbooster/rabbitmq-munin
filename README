To use these plug-ins you (regretfully) have to grant access for the
munin-node user to use rabbitmqctl via sudo.

Add this to your ``/etc/sudoers`` file by running ``visudo``::

    muninuser ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rabbitmqctl list_queues *
    muninuser ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rabbitmqctl list_connections

Be careful and use at your own risk!
